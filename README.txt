Solutions to programming exercises are organized, following the content order in the book Competitive Programming 4: The Lower Bound of Programming Contests in the 2020s (Felix Halim, Steven Halim, & Suhendry Effendy, 2018).

The folder "kattis misc for fun" contains mostly random questions that are not from the book. Although some might have appeared under the 'Extra Kattis' section in programming exercises, these are still placed here and not sorted by topic.

I will not be uploading new solutions in the foreseeable future. This is a random side project I decided to embark on, taking about a year to complete. It was a fun journey :).
